This is a thing you can run to practice morse code with your friends.

It's very simple.
It doesn't try to prevent people from screwing with each other,
or the server.

You can use any key on the keyboard,
or a mouse button,
to key down.

You can also connect a physical key or paddle,
through an Arduino micro running a keyer program.
This program is on github as [vail-adapter](https://github.com/nealey/vail-adapter),
or [in Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/neale/f94bb765-47bd-4bc4-9cbf-b978f7124bdc).
