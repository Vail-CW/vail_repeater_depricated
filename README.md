This is a thing you can run to practice morse code with your friends.
I'm running one at [vail.woozle.org](https://vail.woozle.org/)
if you'd rather not run your own.
Please feel free to use mine.

It's very simple.
It doesn't try to prevent people from screwing with each other,
or the server.

You can also connect a physical key or paddle,
through an Arduino micro running a keyer program.
This program is on github as [vail-adapter](https://github.com/nealey/vail-adapter),
or [in Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/neale/f94bb765-47bd-4bc4-9cbf-b978f7124bdc).
