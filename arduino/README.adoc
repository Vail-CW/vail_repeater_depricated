= Project: USB Morse Adapter

This translates Morse key inputs into USB events,
either MIDI or MIDI+Keyboard,
so you can use a computer.

I use this with an Internet morse code repeater I wrote,
available at https://vail.woozle.org/.

This project requires an Arduino that can send USB.
I've only used the Micro,
although I have no doubt the Leonardo will work too,
as I've used Leonardos for similar projects.


== Step 1: Installation

This needs the MidiUSB and Keyboard libraries.

Installing those is documented all over the Internet.
I'm using https://create.arduino.cc/ so this is all magic for me.


== Step 2: Assmble the circuit

Morse code keyers are very simple devices, 
they just connect two wires together.
You could use a button if you wanted to,
or even touch wires together.

The only real complication here is that some browsers
need to get keyboard events instead of musical instrument events.


=== Decide what browser you're going to use

Firefox needs a jumper between pin 9 and ground.
Just take a wire, and connect pin 9 directly to ground.
This puts the Arduino into "keyboard mode",
where it sends a comma for straight key,
and period and slash for iambic.

If you don't connect pin 9 to ground,
the Arudino only sends MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
events, so it looks like you hooked a piano up.
This works great in Chrome,
and lets you switch to other windows while still keying into vail.

=== Wire up your input device

Hook a straight key into ground on one side,
pin 10 on the other.
It's okay to leave pin 10 disconnected if you don't have a straight key.

Hook an iambic paddle in ground in the middle,
pins 11 and 12 on the outside posts.
It's okay to leave pins 11 and 12 disconnected if you don't have a paddle.

=== Using a headphone jack

If you prefer, you can wire a headphone jack up to GND, 11, and 12.
GND should be the sleeve, 11 the ring, and 12 the tip.

   o  --- 12
  |_| --- 11
  | | --- GND
  | |

Make sure any straight key you plug in has a TS adapter (mono plug):
this will short pin 11 to ground and signal to the Arduino to 
go into straight key mode.

You need to reset the Arduino if you change from an iambic to straight key.
On the micro, reset is a white button.

If you plug in your straight key and it looks like DAH is being held down,
it means you need to switch the connections to pins 11 and 12.

If you plug in your straight key and it looks like DIT is being held down,
it means you need to reset the Arduino to make it detect the key type again.


== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board.

== Step 4: Test it out

Make sure it's plugged in to your computer's USB port.

If you connected pin 9 to ground,
Open anything where you can type,
type in "hello", and hit the straight key.
You should see a comma after your hello.

Now you can open https://vail.woozle.org/,
click the "KEY" button once to let the browser know it's okay to make sound,
and you should be able to wail away on your new USB keyer.

=== BOM

In addition to a key, some hookup wires, and a USB cable,
you only need an Arduino.
