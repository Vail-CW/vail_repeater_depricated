      This is a CW repeater,
      named after Alfred Vail,
      who may or may not have invented what's called "Morse code",
      but clearly had some role in it.

      Just like a radio repeater,
      anybody can connect and start transmitting stuff,
      and this will broadcast it to everyone connected.
      If there's enough interest,
      I'll add something like channels.

      If you need this to work on a cell phone,
      let me know and I'll come up with something for you.
